<p style="text-align:justify">
Modern multidisciplinary materials science routinely processes scientific workflows that integrates different data
resources (e.g., X-ray data, scripts, analytical results). Most of such data resources are isolated in research labs,
created ad-hocly, and remain underutilized. We demonstrate CRUX, a Crowdsourced platform for materials data ResoUrces
and workflow eXploration. CRUX is empowered by coherent data-workflow modelling, knowledge based resource assembly for
workflow search, and data provenance to support workflow exploration. CRUX allows users to declare parameterized
workflows as graph patterns, and automatically recommends crowdsourced resources with quality guarantees. We demonstrate
the ease-of-use and the performance of CRUX with three categories of queries: data search, workflow recommendation, and
resource exploration. We make case of CRUX for peak finding in X-ray Diffraction (XRD) data, a cornerstone task in
materials research. We show that CRUX enables new interactive paradigms to explore and design workflows for data
analysts in general.
